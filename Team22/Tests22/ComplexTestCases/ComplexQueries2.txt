3 - Get variable that is used in assignment and in condition of if and another variable that modifies a while that is parent of that assignment
variable v1, v2; if ifs; while w; assign a;
Select <v1, v2> such that Uses (a, v1) and Modifies (w, v2) such that Parent (w, a) pattern ifs(v1, _, _) with v1.varName = "a"
a a, a r

4 - Get variables that one is modified in a read, used in a assignment and another is used in an assignment with affect relationship between them 
variable v1, v2; read r; assign a1, a2;
Select <v1, v2> such that Modifies (r, v1) and Uses (a1, v1) and Uses (a2, v2) and Follows* (r, a1) and Next* (a1, a2)
none

5 - Get variable that is used in one assignment and another variable modified in another assignment such that one assignment is next of the other
variable v1, v2; while w; assign a1, a2; 
Select <v1, v2> such that Uses (a1, v1) and Modifies (a2, v2) and Follows* (a1, a2) such that Next* (a1, a2) pattern w(v1, _)
e varA, q varA

6 - Get assignment that has parent of while and if and has affect relationship with another assignment that follows that while container
variable v1; if i; while w, w1; assign a1, a2;
Select a2 such that Parent* (i, a2) and Parent (w, a2) and Modifies (a2, v1) and Follows* (a1, w) such that Next*(a1, a2)
41, 46, 56

7 - Get procedure that calls p5 directly or indirectly and modifies a variable used in p5 and this variable is inside an if statement and a while statement with p2.procName = "p5"
procedure p1, p2; variable v1; if i; while w;
Select p1 such that Modifies (p1, v1) such that Uses (p2, v1) such that Parent* (i, w) such that Calls* (p1, p2) with p2.procName = "p5"
p1, p2, p3, p4
5000
8 - Get print statement that uses a variable and has a while container, the variable used in print is also used in an if condition
variable v1, v2; if ifs; while w; assign a; print p;
Select p such that Uses (p, v1) and Uses (a, v2) and Uses (w, v2) and Parent* (w, p) pattern ifs(v1, _, _)
none
5000
9 - Get variable that is used by assignment and a while contaning this assignment modifies this variable, this variable is also used in if statement
variable v1, v2; if ifs, i; while w; assign a;
Select v1 such that Uses (a, v1) and Modifies (w, v1) such that Parent (w, a) such that Uses (i, v1) such that Next*(i, w) pattern ifs(v1, _, _)
a
5000
10 - Get variable that is used by assignment and a while contaning this assignment modifies this variable, this variable is also used in if statement
variable v1, v2; if i; while w1, w2; assign a;
Select v1 such that Uses (w1, v1) and Modifies (w2, v1) such that Parent (w1, a) such that Uses (i, v1) pattern w1(v1, _)
